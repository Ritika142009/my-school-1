 <h1>To transform every child to unravel their optimum potential. To transform the Indian Society with humans optimally fit – mentally, physically & spiritually. To reach farthest corners of the country in the next 20 years to achieve our Mission.</h1>   
    <br>
<h1>School Education has the single biggest effect on a country’s GDP i.e. prosperity & development. FFERT is dedicated to be a dominant player in this quest.

For a country’s growth & development, it is important that citizens understand its rich culture, & heritage and are proud of it. Indian culture, our ancient education system, our Vedas, scriptures are the supreme source of knowledge and embody the highest education principles. Their contribution to the modern advances in the field of sciences, engineering, medicine, humanities etc. are still being discovered.

Our vision is to impart such education to students so that they acquire wisdom from this ancient legacy and develop their skills from modern-day developments. We aim to blend the best of both ancient & modern.</h1>
